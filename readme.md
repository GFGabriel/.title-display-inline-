## .title {display: inline}: A CSS/HTML Educational Game

Hello! Welcome to my repository. This is a demo for a game I created that will help teach children and beginners some HTML and CSS concepts. Each level has 4 screens. The first screen, on the top left, is for the HTML code. The second screen, on the top right, is for housing the CSS code. The third screen, on the bottom left, is the current status of the code. The fourth screen, on the bottom right, is the target status.

The goal of the game is to use the buttons in the container, drop them in the buckets in the HTML and CSS screens, and watch the effects of the code on the current status. Then you manipulate the code to match the target status and move on to the next level. The game starts off simply with just HTML, but quickly introduces CSS as well. The full product will get more complex and aims to teach people how to do some unconventional things with both HTML and CSS.
